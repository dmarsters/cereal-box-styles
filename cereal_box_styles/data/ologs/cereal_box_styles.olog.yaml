# Cereal Box Style Aesthetics - Olog
# Categorical specification of how visual elements compose across 7 design categories
#
# This olog defines the structural relationships between semantic components
# (subject types, action energies, settings, colors) and how they compose
# into coherent visual categories.

  # NATURAL TRANSFORMATIONS (Composability with other domains)

  natural_transformations:
    aesthetic_to_subject_properties:
      description: "How category aesthetics transform subject-specific properties"
      source_olog: "cereal-box-styles"
      target_olog: "any domain with subject types"
      
      mapping_principle: |
        Each category has consistent transformation rules for how subjects
        are conceptualized. These rules can be applied to any domain:
        
        mascot_theater: → add personality and simplify anatomy
        health_halo: → reveal authentic texture and craft
        nostalgia_revival: → apply period-specific illustration approach
        premium_disruptor: → isolate and elevate through shadow/light
        kid_chaos: → exaggerate and make impossible
        transparent_honest: → deconstruct and label systematically
        adventure_fantasy: → mythologize and add magical resonance
      
      preservation_guarantee: |
        The transformation preserves:
        - Recognizability of the subject
        - Intent of the original prompt
        - Coherence within the category aesthetic
    
    color_strategy_transfer:

      transferable_principles:
        - "Saturation level as emotional intensity"
        - "Color count as visual complexity"
        - "Warmth/coolness as psychological tone"
        - "Gradient presence as sophistication level"

  # IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
  # ============================================================================
  
  implementation_notes:
    - "Each Category instance has exactly one VisualStyle, one ColorPalette, one TypographicStyle"
    - "Each Category accepts multiple SubjectTypes, but transforms each consistently"
    - "ActionEnergy applies universally; each Category transforms it distinctly"
    - "SettingTreatment varies by Category AND Setting type (indoor/outdoor/abstract)"
    - "Commutative diagrams ensure no category-internal contradictions"
    - "Natural transformations allow composition with other aesthetic ologs"
  
  extension_points:
    - "Add new Category instances (e.g., 'minimalist_elegance', 'maximalist_collage')"
    - "Add new SubjectTreatment instances for existing categories"
    - "Refine SettingTreatment descriptions as new settings are encountered"
    - "Document new VisualEffect types as they are discovered"
    - "Add new commutative diagrams as new coherence principles emerge"
  
  composition_readiness:
    - "This olog composes with slapstick_comedy (both use exaggeration and energy)"
    - "This olog composes with magazine_photography (both handle subject transformation)"
    - "This olog composes with game_show_aesthetics (both use color and dynamic energy)"
    - "To compose with another domain: identify shared categorical structure"
    - "Map each domain's categories to the other's via natural transformations"
