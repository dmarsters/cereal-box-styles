        - color_saturation_emotional_match (bright = happy)
        These all reinforce each other. Mixing with health_halo's

  cross_category_principles:
    - principle: "Subject Authenticity"
      description: |
        All categories are authentically committed to their own reality.
        Mascot Theater is authentically playful (not pretending to be realistic).
        Health Halo is authentically natural (not pretending to be artistic).
        Each category owns its truth claim fully.
    
    - principle: "Commercial Clarity"
      description: |
        All categories communicate a clear commercial promise.
        The viewer should understand within seconds what this product promises
        and why it's different from other cereal boxes.
    
    - principle: "Sensory Coherence"
      description: |
        In every category, color + typography + effects + treatment
        should feel designed to work together, not assembled randomly.
    
    - principle: "Audience Connection"
      description: |
        Each category reaches for a specific emotional connection with viewers.
        The execution (subject, energy, color, effects) should reinforce that
        emotional register consistently.

      composition_principle: "joy_through_simplification"
      
      why_this_works: |
        The mascot theater says: "This product is fun. Fun is straightforward—
        bright colors, bouncy characters, simple shapes. We're not asking you
        to think; we're asking you to feel joy."
        
        Every choice reinforces that message:
        - Cartoon style: unambiguously playful, no pretense
        - Oversized proportions: exaggerated, making fun of itself
        - Bright primaries: innocent, childlike, direct
        - Motion lines and starbursts: kinetic energy made visible
        - Bubbly typography: can't be serious
        
        The genius is in the simplification. A realistic version would lose
        the joy instantly. The stylization IS the promise.
      
      commercial_promise: "This cereal brings joy. It's for playful eaters."

      why_this_works: |
        Health Halo says: "This is real. Real food, real hands, real care.
        We're not hiding anything—look at the ingredients, the process,
        the authentic materials."
        
        The aesthetic commits to photography, to natural light, to what
        you can actually see and touch. The muted palette says: "We're
        not trying to trick you with neon. We're showing you what's real."
        
        The typography is clean and modern—not playful (that would seem
        dishonest), not fancy (that would seem pretentious). Just clear.
        
        Motion, when present, is subtle—controlled hands at work, not
        dancing characters. The viewer should feel: "These people know
        what they're doing. I can trust this."
      
      commercial_promise: "This is wholesome. It's made with integrity."

      realism_authenticity: "illustrated_historicity"
      energy_expression: "period_accurate_motion"
      color_strategy: "limited_period_palette"
      typography_tone: "nostalgic_accurate"
      visual_effect: "period_stylistic"
      composition_principle: "comfort_through_recognition"
      
      why_this_works: |
        Nostalgia Revival says: "Remember when? This is what you loved
        about that era."
        
        The power here is archaeological—getting the colors, the illustration
        style, the typography, the perspective all right. It's not mimicking
        the era sloppily; it's recreating it with precision.
        
        The subject treatment respects the era's sensibilities. A 1970s
        illustration wouldn't have the oversized proportions of modern mascot
        theater. It wouldn't have photo-realistic health halo lighting.
        
        The limited color palette works because it's authentic to screen
        printing or offset printing of that era. The effects (if any) are
        period-accurate. Even the energy of movement feels period-specific.
        
        The typography isn't just retro-pastiche; it's actually from the era
        (or a faithful recreation). The viewer should feel: "I recognize this.
        This was real."
      
      commercial_promise: "Remember the comfort of [era]? We're bringing it back."
      ideal_subjects: ["human", "animal", "object"]

      typography_tone: "refined_sophisticated"
      visual_effect: "minimalist_refinement"
      composition_principle: "worth_through_minimalism"
      
      why_this_works: |
        Premium Disruptor says: "You deserve better. Premium is not loud.
        It's knowing what to remove."
        
        The visual strategy is aggressive minimalism. Dark backgrounds,
        lots of empty space, the subject isolated and elevated. The subject
        is lit in a way that feels like fine art photography—shadow side,
        with subtle highlights that create presence.
        
        Color is almost completely absent except for selective accent
        (gold, silver, a hint of jewel tone). The restraint communicates
        luxury more effectively than ornamentation ever could.
        
        The typography is sans-serif, modern, but not trendy. It's timeless
        refinement. Not playful, not nostalgic—just elegant.
        
        Effects are minimal: maybe a subtle shadow, maybe a refined edge light.
        Nothing draws attention except the subject itself. The viewer should feel:
        "This is curated. Someone with taste designed this. I want to be associated
        with this."
      
      commercial_promise: "This is premium. It's designed for discerning people."

      typography_tone: "expressive_uninhibited"
      visual_effect: "exuberant_impossible"
      composition_principle: "excitement_through_abundance"
      
      why_this_works: |
        Kid Chaos says: "Too much is not enough. Excitement is sensory overload."
        
        This is the opposite of minimalism. Every part of the frame is active.
        Patterns layer on patterns. Colors don't harmonize; they vibrate.
        The subject is in impossible perspective, bent at impossible angles,
        with hair/clothing flying impossibly.
        
        The energy is kinetic to the point of chaos. Not just dynamic—unhinged.
        Motion lines don't just suggest movement; they create visual chaos.
        Effects aren't subtle; they're explosive.
        
        The typography is wild and expressive—might be distorted, condensed,
        tilted. Every letterform has personality and chaos. The colors are neon
        saturation, hurting to look at in the best way.
        
        The viewer should feel: "This is overwhelming. And it's amazing."
        The excess is the promise: "Your experience with this product will be
        INTENSE."
      
      commercial_promise: "This is EXTREME. For kids who want everything LOUD."

      visual_effect: "informational_systematic"
      composition_principle: "clarity_through_systematization"
      
      why_this_works: |
        Transparent Honest says: "We have nothing to hide. Here's exactly
        what you're getting, labeled and documented."
        
        The visual strategy is clinical and informational. The background is
        white (nothing hidden behind it). The subject is shown in exploded view,
        or labeled, or documented step-by-step.
        
        Color is used only for function: blue for information, red for warning,
        green for positive. No decorative color. The typography is technical
        sans-serif—utterly clear, utterly readable.
        
        Effects aren't decorative; they're informational (measurement overlays,
        labels, directional arrows). Every visual element serves clarity.
        
        The subject has no added personality (scientific objectivity). The energy
        is documented and calm (this is a process, not a performance).
        
        The viewer should feel: "I understand what I'm buying. This brand
        respects my intelligence enough to show me everything."

      why_this_works: |
        Adventure Fantasy says: "Eating this is an adventure. You're entering
        an epic story."
        
        Every visual choice serves myth-making. The subject is backlit, heroic,
        positioned at a cliff edge or cosmic vista. The lighting is cinematic
        and impossible—god rays, volumetric fog, colors that glow from within.
        
        The color palette is saturated and dramatic: deep blues and purples,
        fiery oranges and golds, emerald greens with shimmer. Colors don't just
        exist; they glow.
        
        The typography is stylized—might have a subtle glow or shadow, feels
        magical and otherworldly. The subject is transformed into a legendary
        version of itself (a person becomes a hero, an animal becomes a mythical
        creature).
        
        Effects are magical: particle effects, magical auras, impossible physics.
        The energy is epic and cinematic—slow-motion heroism or reality-bending
        power.
        
        The viewer should feel: "This is not normal. This is an adventure.
        This is worth being mythologized."
      
      commercial_promise: "This is an adventure. Make your breakfast epic."

      step_1_identify_intent: |
        What is your domain trying to make people feel or believe?
        Write it as a one-sentence core intention.
        (e.g., "This cereal is fun" vs "This cereal is healthy")
      
      step_2_derive_principles: |
        Given that core intention, what sensory principles must hold?
        If the intent is "fun," then:
        - Subject personality must be high (playful characters)
        - Realism can be low (cartoons are fine)
        - Color must be saturated (joy = bright)
        - Energy must be exaggerated (fun = dynamic)
      
      step_3_design_coherently: |
        Make sure every choice (subject, color, typography, effects)
        reinforces the core intention. Don't mix intentions.
      
      step_4_document_binding_principle: |
        What is the one idea that explains why all your choices work
        together? That's your composition principle.

      - "Transparent Honest + Data Visualization: both emphasize clarity as ethics"
      - "Adventure Fantasy + Epic Cinema: both emphasize mythology as meaning-making"
